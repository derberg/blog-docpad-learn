              This blog is not about my life, my thoughts (maybe a bit) and my feelings.
              I decided to create and write this blog to share my knowledge, to give something from me to the community.
              I want to pay back to people like <a href='https://balupton.com/'>Benjamin Lupton</a>, who creates for the community.
              I just got infected with the love to open-source.

            <h2>What You Won't Find Here</h2>

            <p>
              I'm clearly not a native english speaker. I'm clearly not good in english grammar. And I don't really care.
              Technical Writer that doesn't care about correct english? Strange, huh?
              I was writing software documentation for almost 4 years.  My target audience - mainly developers, mostly not native speakers.
              I've quickly learned from various sources that language is not what they care about. They care about:
            </p>
            <ul>
              <li>
                Technical quality of the content
              </li>
              <li>
                Having documentation up to date
              </li>
              <li>
                Getting desired content quickly!
              </li>
            </ul>
            <p>
              So please don't hate me for wrong english. Let me know where I've made mistake and I'll fix that with a pleasure. Maybe you want to become the editor of this blog? I'd love to have you on board then!
            </p>

            <h2>What You Can Find Here</h2>

            <p>
              You should find here a bunch of technical guides, hints and explanations required to understand DocPad. Why DocPad? It is a tool that the whole writers community should start using.
              With this tool you can build a documentation portal (not only documentation) without any special costs and expensive consultancy. You can shape the structure of your portal in favour of your content.
              You do not have to shape your content the way it fits your documentation tool limitations.
            </p>
            <p>
              So I will mainly write about DocPad and all the other awesome tools I use together with DocPad. Ambitious plan is that:
            </p>
            <ul>
              <li>
                  The functionality of this blog will be very poor at the beginning and will grow with each post, with description how it was possible to add such functionality.
              </li>
              <li>
                  I will try to extract the technical part of each post and use it as some kind on instruction document. Blog will have another section called documentation where all the technical documents will be listed/grouped with proper navigation. So almost the same, but without useless story telling parts.
              </li>
            </ul>
            <p>
              I strongly believe that this is going to be the best way to share the knowlege I have with you guys.
            </p>

            <h2>A Bit About Me</h2>

            <p>
              I think it is right to say, that my origin is software technical writing.
              I was(am) good in writing technical documentation - at least this is what I've heard.
              I also had my methods to make sure the technical content is up to date from version to version.
              I was just super frustrated, with the fact that I have no influence on the documentation tool and how readers interact with it.
              I like to work for satisfaction, I think. Maybe I'm not working in NASA, or not saving lives of kids in Africa - that is clear.
              Nevertheless I like to think that I don't go to the office just to get money from my employeer.
              I just want to know that the work I've done is usefull for others. Want to get feedback and improve. How can I have it, is nobody can find my documents because of crappy search and navigation?
              <br>
              Am I just lying to myself?
            </p>
            <p>
              Now I'm in a team that implements totally new approach for writing documentation. We can influence the whole documentation portal - it's shape, functionality, navigation and design.
              So looks like I can get ried of my frustrations, which is kind of perfect win-win situation.
            </p>
