description: Get feedback, enable your audience to comment your content
---

Every serious content provider wants to get a feedback. When I started working as a Software Technical Writer few years ago, I wanted to know if my work matters, if my audience likes it, if there is anything I could do better. We had all the feedback features there, `like` function, rating with starts and commenting. Likes are cool, rating also gives you a good feeling about the quality. Nevertheless nothing is as valuable as comments. Our problem was that commenting feature was pretty basic with useless notification system and no management functionality...so we decided to switch it off.

I've learned few months ago that there is an awesome 3rd party tool for enabling comments on your page. It is really cool tool with management console, blacklisting and others. The tool is called [Disqus](https://disqus.com/). Ever since then, I can see disqus is used almost everywhere possible.

## Get Disqus

Of course, first you need to sign up for disqus account. Then you need to select **Add disqus to your site** option and provide:
* Site name: For example `exTW Blog`
* Disqus URL: For accessing management console. Can be the same as site name.
* Category: Choose whatever you want.

Then you can copy the code that is suggested for so called installation of the feature on your page. For DocPad we need universal code. This is a super simple html's div element and some JavaScript:

```
<div id="disqus_thread"></div>
<script type="text/javascript">
    /* * * CONFIGURATION VARIABLES * * */
    var disqus_shortname = 'extwblog';

    /* * * DON'T EDIT BELOW THIS LINE * * */
    (function() {
        var dsq = document.createElement('script'); dsq.type = 'text/javascript'; dsq.async = true;
        dsq.src = '//' + disqus_shortname + '.disqus.com/embed.js';
        (document.getElementsByTagName('head')[0] || document.getElementsByTagName('body')[0]).appendChild(dsq);
    })();
</script>
<noscript>Please enable JavaScript to view the <a href="https://disqus.com/?ref_noscript" rel="nofollow">comments powered by Disqus.</a></noscript>
```

The only part you need to modify in the code is the **disqus_shortname** variable value, the name you've provided as a Disqus URL.

## Embed Disqus in DocPad Project

Now all you need to do is to place above code in your project in a proper place, to get the disqus comment at the bottom of each post. This blog consists of two layouts (I wrote more about layouts [here](/posts/2015-02-21.html#layouts)). The **default** layout is not something we should touch as it is inherited by all blog pages, which means that anything add there will be populated to all pages - and we don't want to have commenting on main blog page for example.

The layout that we need to modify is the **post** layout. Every blog post is built with this layout.
Looking on a part of the code of the layout:

```
<!-- Post Content -->
<article>
    <div class="container">
        <div class="row">
            <div class="col-lg-8 col-lg-offset-2 col-md-10 col-md-offset-1">
                <!-- Content of any document that uses this layout is placed here, document by document during DocPad generation process  -->
                <%- @content %>
            </div>
        </div>
    </div>
</article>
```

Each post is added in this place: **<%- @content %>**. We want to add comments below the article content, so we just need to add disqus code below **<%- @content %>** tag to keep disqus in the same bootstrap grid (to keep responsivenes and all that stuff):

```
<!-- Post Content -->
<article>
    <div class="container">
        <div class="row">
            <div class="col-lg-8 col-lg-offset-2 col-md-10 col-md-offset-1">
                <!-- Content of any document that uses this layout is placed here, document by document during DocPad generation process  -->
                <%- @content %>
                <div id="disqus_thread"></div>
                <script type="text/javascript">
                    /* * * CONFIGURATION VARIABLES * * */
                    var disqus_shortname = 'extwblog';

                    /* * * DON'T EDIT BELOW THIS LINE * * */
                    (function() {
                        var dsq = document.createElement('script'); dsq.type = 'text/javascript'; dsq.async = true;
                        dsq.src = '//' + disqus_shortname + '.disqus.com/embed.js';
                        (document.getElementsByTagName('head')[0] || document.getElementsByTagName('body')[0]).appendChild(dsq);
                    })();
                </script>
                <noscript>Please enable JavaScript to view the <a href="https://disqus.com/?ref_noscript" rel="nofollow">comments powered by Disqus.</a></noscript>
            </div>
        </div>
    </div>
</article>
```

And that is it. Just 2 steps and you have commenting feature enabled on your static page. So if you don't want to provide me a feedback on twitter, please do so using my newest commenting option.
