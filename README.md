# What Is It

It is a project based on DocPad and other technologies. With this project I'm building a blog and host its content on GitHub Pages.

# Local Installation

2. Call `docpad run`

# Used Technologies

* [DocPad](https://docpad.org/) to generate the blog static page
* [CleanBlog Theme](http://startbootstrap.com/template-overviews/clean-blog/)
* [Bootstrap](http://getbootstrap.com/) to have a super responsive design

# License

I'm not good in licensing. Know that there are several like MIT, Apache2, common something, but never understood the difference. I think that MIT is the best one to use for open source. So let me say the license is MIT.

Thing is that I just want to share my knowledge with others. My work is built on the efforts of others, I hope mine will contribute to yours. Enjoy!
